# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
* In this analysis we are tasked with auditing a recent Colorado Board of Elections local congressional election. In order to complete this audit, we were tasked with the following:
1. Tabulating the total number of votes cast in the election.
2. Populating a list of all the counties in the congressional precinct along with the total number of votes and percentage of total votes for each.
3. Determining which county had the largest number of votes in the election.
4. Populating a list of all candidates who received votes.
5. Calulating the total number of votes received by each candidate and the total percentage of votes won by each candidate.
6. Determining the winner of the election based on popular vote.
